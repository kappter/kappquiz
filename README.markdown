# Vocabulary Quiz System

The Vocabulary Quiz System is a web-based application designed to help students practice and master vocabulary terms for educational purposes. It allows users to take quizzes from preloaded vocabulary sets, track their progress, and generate reports to assess their readiness for state tests.

## Features

- **Preloaded Vocabulary Sets**: Includes two preloaded sets (`utah_video_production_terms_Final.csv` and `Exploring_Computer_Science_Vocabulary.csv`) for immediate use.
- **Question Mode Selection**:
  - Choose between three question modes: "Term to Definition," "Definition to Term," or "Mixed (Both)."
  - Users must select a question mode before the vocabulary set dropdown is enabled, ensuring the mode impacts the quiz.
- **Interactive Quiz**:
  - Multiple-choice questions with four options per question.
  - The "Next" button is disabled until an option is selected, preventing accidental skips.
  - Visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers with color-coded options (teal for correct, red for incorrect).
  - Navigation between questions using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
  - Progress tracking with a running score percentage displayed during the quiz.
- **Missed Terms Retake**:
  - Tracks missed terms during the quiz.
  - Offers a "Retake Missed Terms" option to practice only the terms answered incorrectly.
- **Report Generation**:
  - Generates a detailed HTML report with the student's name, score, and state test readiness (based on a score above 80%).
  - Includes a table of all answers, showing the term, question type, user's answer, correct answer, result, and strand.
  - Option to print the report directly from the browser.
- **Theme Switching**:
  - Supports light and dark themes, with the selected theme persisted across sessions using `localStorage`.
  - Custom color swatch (`#389377`, `#38938D`, `#388293`, `#386B93`, `#385493`) applied to buttons, options, and correct answers for a cohesive look.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
  - Buttons stack vertically on smaller screens for better usability.
  - Footer links adjust to a vertical layout on mobile devices.
- **Teacher Dashboard** (Placeholder):
  - A placeholder teacher dashboard is included (accessible via `?mode=teacher` URL parameter).
  - Currently displays a message that vocab sets are preloaded, with upload functionality disabled.
